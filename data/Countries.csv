- Be at least the required minimum age.
- Hold a valid medical certificate (specific to your license type).

- Submitting identification documents.
- Passing a medical exam.

To start your journey as a pilot in Lithuania, you must first meet the general prerequisites:
- Be at least the required minimum age.
- Hold a valid medical certificate (specific to your license type).

Before you can start flight training, you will need to apply for a Student Pilot License (SPL) through Lithuania's Aviation Authority. This process typically involves:
- Submitting identification documents.
- Passing a medical exam.
- Completing initial ground school.

Step 4: Accumulate Flight Hours

Introduction
Becoming a pilot in Guatemala is an exciting and challenging journey. Whether you're interested in flying commercially or privately, understanding the steps, requirements, and processes involved is crucial. This guide will provide detailed information on how you can achieve your dream of becoming a pilot in Guatemala.

Step 1: Meet the Basic Requirements
To start your journey as a pilot in Guatemala, you must first meet the general prerequisites:
- Be at least the required minimum age.
- Hold a valid medical certificate (specific to your license type).
- Have a strong command of the English language (mandatory for international flight).

Step 2: Access the Most Comprehensive Flight School Database
Instead of searching for schools on your own, PilotCenter.net provides you with the most comprehensive, complete, and up-to-date database of flight schools in Guatemala and globally. Our database allows you to choose a flight school that best fits your needs and location.

Step 3: Obtain Your Student Pilot License (SPL)
Before you can start flight training, you will need to apply for a Student Pilot License (SPL) through Guatemala's Aviation Authority. This process typically involves:
- Submitting identification documents.
- Passing a medical exam.
- Completing initial ground school.

Step 4: Accumulate Flight Hours
After securing your SPL, you will begin logging flight hours. In Guatemala, the requirements to qualify for different licenses (such as a Private Pilot License (PPL) or Commercial Pilot License (CPL)) will vary.

We help negotiate the best possible training cost for you at any school you choose from our database, ensuring you get the best value.

Step 5: Pass the Theoretical and Practical Exams
To earn your license, you must pass both theoretical and practical examinations. These exams are conducted by Guatemala's Aviation Authority and typically include:
- Written exams on navigation, meteorology, regulations, and aircraft systems.
- Practical flight test with an examiner.

Step 6: Additional Licensing and Specializations
If you want to fly commercially, you will need to upgrade your license to a CPL or an Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL). This requires additional training and exams. Specializations such as instrument rating (IR) or multi-engine rating (MER) may also be necessary depending on your career goals.
