  "about": "Penobscot Island Air Flight School, based at Knox County Regional Airport, offers comprehensive flight training in the scenic Maine Penobscot Bay region. Our program requires a minimum of 40 hours of flight training, 15 hours of ground training, an FAA Medical Exam, and passing the FAA written and checkride exams. Students are assigned a primary instructor who tailors the training to their schedule, with additional instructors available to ensure continuity. We use Cessna 172 and C150 aircraft, with costs ranging from $10,000 to $12,000 to become a private pilot. Safety is our top priority, and we only fly in safe and legal weather conditions. Discovery flights are available for those unsure about pursuing a pilot's license. With a commitment to home study and preparation, our students can achieve their aviation goals, whether for recreation or a career in aviation. Contact us to meet our instructors and tour our facilities, and let us help you exceed your aviation aspirations.",
