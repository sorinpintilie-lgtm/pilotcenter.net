  "about": "Sunshine Coast Aerobatics School is a unique flying school based in Queensland, Australia, specializing in advanced pilot skills training. Established in 2012, we initially operated as the ‘Ultimate Thrill Ride’ at Sunshine Coast Airport, offering aerobatics flights and advanced training. In 2018, co-owners Colin Appleton and Lawrie Stevens expanded to form Sunshine Coast Flying School, adding top-class training aircraft like the TL 2000 Sting S4 and Sting RG Turbo. In 2024, we refocused as Sunshine Coast Aerobatics School, dedicating ourselves to teaching GA aerobatics and advanced handling skills. Our training includes Aerobatics, Spin Prevention & Recovery, and Upset Prevention & Recovery, using aircraft like the Robin R2160. We are the Sunshine Coast Training Campus for the Australian Aerobatic Club and have produced numerous State and National Aerobatics Champions. Start your aviation journey with us and learn to fly in 3 dimensions.",
