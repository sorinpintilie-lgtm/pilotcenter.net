  "about": "The Uzbekistan Airways Aviation Training Center is the premier institution for pilot training in Uzbekistan. Established to meet the growing demands of the aviation industry, the center offers comprehensive training programs for civil aviation pilots. Previously reliant on foreign flight schools, the center now provides initial training locally, adhering to international standards and Uzbekistan's own rigorous criteria. The training includes theoretical modules in aviation law, aeronautics theory, and aircraft design, followed by practical training using modern simulators and ultra-light training aircraft. The center aims to train at least 25-30 civil pilots annually and has expanded its facilities with new simulators and training aircraft to ensure high-quality education. The training center is committed to producing highly qualified pilots who will join the flight staff of Uzbekistan Airways, ensuring the airline's continued excellence and safety standards.",
