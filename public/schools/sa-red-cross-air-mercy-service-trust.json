  "about": "The SA Red Cross Air Mercy Service Trust (AMS), established in 1966, is a non-profit aero-medical rescue organisation. Originally founded by the South African Red Cross Society, it became an independent trust in 1994. AMS provides comprehensive air ambulance, health outreach, and rescue services using a mix of fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft, as well as ground vehicles. With bases in the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Eastern Cape, and supportive infrastructure in other provinces, AMS ensures 24/7 access to healthcare for critically ill or injured persons, especially in remote rural communities. The service is licensed by the South African Civil Aviation Authority and operates under rigorous training and safety standards, committed to saving lives and improving the quality of life for vulnerable communities. AMS works closely with Provincial Departments of Health and other stakeholders to deliver equitable healthcare access.",
