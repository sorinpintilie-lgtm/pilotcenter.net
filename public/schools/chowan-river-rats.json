  "about": "Chowan River Rats is a specialized flying school located at the Rat Landing Seaplane Base on the Chowan River in Winton, North Carolina. We offer comprehensive seaplane training programs, including sport, recreational, private, and commercial seaplane ratings. Our instructors are experienced pilots, with one of our founders currently flying Airbus 319/320 for a major airline. We utilize a STOL-equipped PA-12 on straight floats, providing students with unique training on a river environment rather than a lake. Nearby accommodations, including a nice B&B, are available for students. Our training focuses on improving flying skills in a challenging and scenic environment, making it an exciting and educational experience for all pilots. Join us to earn your seaplane rating and enjoy the thrill of water flying.",
