  "about": "The Harvard Club of South Africa, established in 1990, is dedicated to preserving the aviation heritage of the North American Harvard aircraft. Launched during the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Harvard, the club aims to recruit members involved with the aircraft since 1940, particularly those associated with the South African Air Force Association (SAAFA). Based at AFB SWKP, the club maintains and flies a fleet of Harvards, now certified as National Heritage items. Through various air shows, fly-ins, and fundraising activities like sky typing, the club ensures these historic aircraft remain in South Africa for future generations. The club's efforts are supported by enthusiasts, including the younger generation, who work tirelessly to preserve this aviation legacy. The Harvard Club of South Africa continues to thrive, celebrating and protecting the history of these iconic aircraft.",
